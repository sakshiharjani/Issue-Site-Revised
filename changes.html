          <p class="changesPassage">Wondering what you can do to help? Talk about it! The stigma surrounding mental illnesses needs to be gone in order for the higher likelihood of people in power listening to us. Support your friends who have mental illnesses, and if you feel comfortable speaking of your experiences, go ahead! It's one thing for somebody to make a statement saying that they support those with mental illnesses, and it's another to be there for each other.</p><p class="changesPassage">Put pressure on your state senators and representatives to take charge against the high costs of mental health care. Tell them that more areas in the country need to have better access to mental health services. More available services in schools, workplaces, and the general public are necessary to improve the qualities of mental health all over the country.<a class= "sourceButton" href="https://www.thenationalcouncil.org/press-releases/new-study-reveals-lack-of-access-as-root-cause-for-mental-health-crisis-in-america/"> (Source)</a></p>
